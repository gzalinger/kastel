HIGH PRIORITY
- tower fight positions for large regiments (2 and 5 are done)
-redo splash damage so it covers actual number of sub-tiles
- map editor
	-> make restrictions panel
	-> FINISH: map editor panel 
		- add function to all buttons (terrain, spawn points, structures, village structures, towers)
		- make copy of all stuff (terrain, initial city) when editor panel is created
	-> make attack wave editor panel
== == == == == == == == == == == == == == == == ==
- repairing damage at village structures
- walls around unfinished structures shouldn't count
- second column for control panel when there's too much stuff
- next step: stop 1-to-1 relationship between tiles and regiments
	-> handle large engineer regiments (e.g. 5) working on towers
		- ignore paths that are too long, limit search distance
	-> return monsters to formation after tower fights
	-> fighting walls
	-> melees
	-> handle units in marching formation getting killed (e.g. by towers)
	-> redo monster AI (restore attacking various things)
	-> engineers should return to formation after working on a tower
- next step: outposts
- regiments' move rate (from terrain) should be based on slowest unit
- restore monsters attacking (damaging) structures
- fix map preview screen


MEDIUM PRIORITY
- improve/overhaul monster AI
- examples of horse and mechanical units
- add all structures (with images), complete tech tree
- towers can't be attacked when they have two adjacent walls
- archer towers w/ stone (other than current level 2 tower) [design]
- shutter farms when all adjacent hamlets are gone
- pause / unpause button for defense phase
- add "snipe" spell to give players something to do

LOW PRIORITY
- refine 'which tile did you click on' logic (cuz your current version sucks)
- images for walls (on map)
- add random factor to damage
- update pathfinding when a step potentially becomes blocked (player regiments only)
- incorporate pathfinding with long-range attack commands (button and mouse)
- make pathfinding better (at long distance) <- WAYPOINTS
- regiments with ranged attacks (player and monster)
- move gates forward with city limits as if they were normal walls
- mountains that block LOS
- between-level upgrades
- moving regiments should partially be in last location; make this work well with closing gates and attacking regiments that are on the move
- structures should be their own terrain type (for movement speeds)
- forest effects (i.e. protect against ranged attacks)
- make gatehouse structure itself invincible (DESIGN too)
- add encyclopedia for structures, towers, walls, regiments
- ability for player to manually target towers

Converting to real-time
- DONE: remove separate waves from levels
- DONE: add "day length" and "night length", including default values
- DONE: switch between night and day, indicate in graphically
- DONE: build projects progress in real time
- DONE: upgrades finish in real time
- DONE: remove wave indicator from top of UI
- DONE: move market panel to top of screen
- DONE: add 'play sandbox' and 'play campaign' buttons
- DONE: spawn player regiments
- DONE: placeholder automatic/procedural monster generator (for 'sandbox' mode)
- DONE: workers that build structures?

- LATER: regenerate player regiments in real time? peasants for footmen
- LATER: repairing structures?
- LATER: repairing walls?
- LATER: redo food system
- LATER: peasant population growth
- LATER: fog of war
- LATER: resources on tiles (different from terrain type) including wood, scrap, and fertile land for farms

Design Ideas
- slow/freeze towers
- monster spellcasters
- 'heroes' that accompany regiments (enemy spellcasters and champions, heroes with inter-level rpg elements for player)
- "sapper" repair regiment
- "hospital" struct that can heal regiments during defend phase
- both wooden AND stone archer towers

-> spell "slots" that player can fill from variety of spells provided by their structures (and they should be able to fill at least one slot from beginning)
